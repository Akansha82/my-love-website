            <p>
                I never knew I would ever meet such a beautiful soul in my life. You are the most miraculous thing that has ever happened to me—a gift from God that I am truly blessed with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Words may never be enough to express how much you mean to me. When you are with me, I feel more alive; tensions and problems seem small because your presence makes me strong. I want you forever. I want us forever. I want our love to last forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish for your happiness, good health, and success. May you always be blessed, strong, and surrounded by endless joy. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-end">Yours forever, <br> Akansha ❤️</h3>
